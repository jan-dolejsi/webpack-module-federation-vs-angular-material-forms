# Angular Material (reactive) forms vs Webpack module federation issue repro

This repo is the least repro sample to show the Angular Material reactive forms issue I am facing when the Form is loaded via its remoteEntry.js to the app shell.

The sample uses Angular 16.
The general approach for the Module Federation is described in [Dynamic Module Federation with Angular](https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/blog/dynamic-module-federation-with-angular/).

## Running the sample

|            | App shell                              | Micro-frontend |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| sub-folder | [/remote_app_shell](/remote_app_shell) | [/mfe1](/mfe1) |
| serve      | cd remote_app_shell && npx ng serve    | cd mfe1 && npx ng build --project ngx-my-components && npx ng serve |
| browse     | <http://localhost:3200/>               | <http://localhost:4201/> |

Here are the steps how to reproduce this:

## App shell

### How to run the sample

```bash
cd remote_app_shell
npm install
npx ng serve
```

### How to rebuild the sample yourself

If you want to re-build the sample (while customizing it for your purposes), here is how its done:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@16.2.10 -g
ng new remote_app_shell --prefix app-shell --routing --style scss
npm uninstall @angular/cli -g

cd remote_app_shell
npm install
```

Switch the default `@angular-devkit/build-angular` to `ngx-build-plus`:

```bash
npx ng add ngx-build-plus@16.0.0
```

Add Module Federation.

```bash
npx ng add @angular-architects/module-federation@16.0.4 --type host --project remote_app_shell --port 3200
```

Then in the `remote_app_shell` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

1. replace the [app.component.html](./remote_app_shell/src/app/app.component.html) `<p>Host application</p>`,
2. add `routerLink` to navigate to `/mfe1` and the router outlet.

Point your browser to <http://localhost:3200/>

## Microfrontend

### How to run the MFE1 sample

```bash
cd mfe1
npm install
npx ng serve
```

### How to rebuild the MFE sample yourself

```bash
npm install @angular/cli@16.2.10 -g
ng new mfe1 --prefix mfe1 --routing --style scss
npm uninstall @angular/cli -g

cd mfe1
npm install
npx ng add @angular-architects/module-federation@16.0.4 --type remote --project mfe1 --port 4201
```

Then in the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

Replace the [app.component.html](./mfe1/src/app/app.component.html) `<p>Standalone Micro-frontend 1</p>` and the router outlet.

Create the module that will become the micro-frontend exposed for remote consumption:

```bash
npx ng generate module module-a --project mfe1 --routing --routing-scope Child
```

Add simple _home_ component to the module A:

```bash
npx ng generate component module-a/home --standalone --style css --project mfe1
```

Add simple _feature_ component to the module A (the one that will require dependency injection later):

```bash
npx ng generate component module-a/feature --standalone --style css --project mfe1
```

Add a router link to the Home component to navigate to the Feature component.

To test the micro-frontend as a standalone Angualar app, point your browser to <http://localhost:4201/>

## Register Micro-frontend in the App Shell

Add webpack exposes/remotes configuration. The vital configuration is spread across following files:

/mfe1/webpack.config.js -> see the `exposes` field\
/remote_app_shell .. webpack.config.js -> see the `remotes` field\
/remote_app_shell .. app-routing.module.ts -> adds the lazy-loaded mfe1 routes
/remote_app_shell .. declarations.d.ts -> declare the remote module for the tsc compiler's sake

See commit # TBD for more detail.

## Add _Hello World_ services and inject it to the component

Then in the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate service module-a/hello --project mfe1 --skip-tests
```

And add the `greet(name: string)` method.\
Inject it into the `FeatureComponent` to show _Hello, World_.

## Make the _Hello World_ service derive from an abstract service

Suppose the `FeatureComponent` could be used in different contexts with the data coming from different kinds of data sources.
The dependency injection in the Module-A could then inject the appropriate implementation of the abstract service.

Inside the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate service module-a/french.hello --project mfe1 --skip-tests
```

Make the original `HelloService` service `abstract` (both the class and the method)
and make the `BonjoursService` extend and implement it.

The protected `capitalize(name)` method in the `HelloService` is also added to demonstrate
that the service base class may provide some base capability for all the derived service (i.e. the language mutations).

## Split the MFE module to MFE and Web Component library

For re-usability, you may want to keep your (Angular) web components in a separate library project (which you could also publish as such in NPM).

Inside the `mfe1` subfolder:

```bash
npx ng generate library ngx-my-components --standalone --prefix mywc
```

Delete the component and service that was created inside `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components` (and from the `public-api.ts`).

Instead, move the `mfe1\src\app\module-a\feature` folder to `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components/src/lib` and export the `feature/feature.component` via the `mfe1/projects/ngx-my-components/src/public-api.ts`.

Same with the `hello.service.ts`. Move that also to `ngx-my-components/src/lib`, because the `FeatureComponent` depends on it.

Adjust the imports in the module-a files to:

```typescript
import { HelloService, FeatureComponent } from 'ngx-my-components';
```

Now you need to build the `ngx-my-components` component library before serving the `mfe1`.

```bash
npx ng build --project ngx-my-components && npx ng serve
```

This is what you should see in the standalone (left) and remote app shell (right):
